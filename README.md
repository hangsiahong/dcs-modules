Storage Provider Pallet: This pallet would handle the registration, verification, and management of storage providers. It would include functions to onboard new providers, validate their storage capacity and reliability, manage their reputation, and handle provider rewards and commissions.

File Storage Pallet: This pallet would handle the core functionality of storing and retrieving files within the decentralized cloud platform. It would include functions to upload files, assign content addresses, manage file metadata (such as file names, sizes, and timestamps), handle file versioning, and ensure file redundancy and availability across storage providers.

Payment and Incentive Pallet: This pallet would manage the payment system and incentives within the platform. It would handle transactions between storage buyers and providers, calculate and distribute provider commissions, maintain payment records, and potentially integrate with external payment systems or cryptocurrencies.

Governance Pallet: This pallet would handle the governance aspects of the platform, allowing participants to propose and vote on system upgrades, parameter changes, or new features. It would include functions for proposal submission, voting mechanisms, and execution of approved changes.

User Management Pallet: This pallet would handle user authentication, access control, and user-related functionalities. It would include functions to register new users, manage user permissions, handle user authentication and authorization, and potentially integrate with external identity systems or decentralized identity frameworks.

Reputation Pallet: This pallet would manage the reputation system for storage providers and potentially for users as well. It would collect and store feedback from storage buyers about their experiences with providers, calculate and update reputation scores, and use this information for provider selection and incentivization.

Interoperability Pallet: If you plan to integrate with other blockchain networks or decentralized applications, you may need an interoperability pallet. This pallet would handle cross-chain communication, bridging, or integration with other Substrate-based chains or external networks.
